## **Enhancing IoT Security with Machine Learning Models**





This project represents a comparative analysis of Machine Learning models for IoT network intrusion detection within a blockchain environment, using 2 cybersecurity datasets: NSL-KDD and KDD Cup-99



###### \* Models tested: 

Random Forest,

SVM

K-NN

Decision Tree 

Logistic Regression

AdaBoost

Naive Bayes





###### \* TO TEST OUR MODELS:

1. DDownload the 2 datasets:



\- KDD CUP 99(the complete one): https://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html



\- NSL KDD: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hassan06/nslkdd

P.S: you need to merge KDDTrain+ and KDDTest+ and name it KDDmerged



2\. Place the datasets, field\_names.csv, and main.py in the same directory, 



3\. Run main.py



You will see the resuls in the command line and then two figures will be plotted.
